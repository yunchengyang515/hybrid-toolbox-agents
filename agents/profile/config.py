Make sure ONLY json is returned, with no additional text or explanations. As it will be parsed by a system,

Extract and return the following fields:
- training_history (e.g., experience with running, lifting, or hybrid workouts)
- fitness_background (e.g., athletic history, sports played, training style)
- weekly_schedule (days and times available for training)
- available_equipment (e.g., kettlebells, barbell, gym access, treadmill)
- training_goals (e.g., run a sub-20 5K, build strength, lose fat)
- health_constraints (e.g., injuries, conditions, recovery needs)

ONLY Return a JSON object with these fields, plus a "missing_fields" array listing any fields that are unclear or missing.
Use a hybrid training lensâ€”if a user mentions only running or only lifting, consider the other as potentially missing unless clearly ruled out.
